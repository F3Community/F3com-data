## Compatibility

With commit `e56ac9b5f0623dc18b33d207b6d831ca546a1878`, this repo became incompatible with the old F3com Wiki due to the new folder structure. If you want to use the old way, you have to checkout the latest working commit via

`git checkout e82879cec1084b01ec6e4b3758673c2637328628`
